# Databases


Art Gallery Database Management Project

The objectives of the project included designing a database, implementing the database in SQL, retrieving some aggravated data, and make some database indexes and measure the performance of the queries.

The Gallery contains some tables like artists customers type of art, groups etc. which have information about them. First, we have a Country table which has an id and name. Then each gallery has some Customers. They must register before purchasing. Customers are known by customer name, address, the amount that they have spent and country. Registered customers can follow different group of art, choose any type of group, artist and so on. Here are more tables and their data.
